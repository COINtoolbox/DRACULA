DRACULA - Dimensionality Reduction And Clustering for Unsupervised Learning in Astronomy


DRACULA is a software designed to make classification of objects using dimensionality reduction and clustering.
This package was introduced for exploring the spectroscopic diversity of type Ia supernovae
in M. Sasdelli et al. 2015 (http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06810).
The code has as base the tools developed in scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., JMLR 12, pp. 2825-2830, 2011),
with some usage requiring also the H2O pachage (http://h2o.ai/resources/).

Nevertheless, this code was developed for easy interface and can be 
applied to make classification and separation of several types of objects.

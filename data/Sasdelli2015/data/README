This folder contains all data used in Sasdelli et al., 2015.


- clustering_KMeans_4features_4groups.dat
Centers of the 4 groups found when applying the Kmeans algorithm (demanding 4 groups) to the 4-dimensional deep learning results. 

- clustering_KMeans_label_4features_2groups.dat
- clustering_KMeans_label_4features_3groups.dat
- clustering_KMeans_label_4features_4groups.dat
Labels assigned by the Kmeans algorithm when applied to the 4-dimensional deep learning results.
Files correspond to results when 2, 3, and 4 groups are required. 
each line correspond to the class of one SNIa spectra at maximum.

- derivatives_all_epochs.dat 
Derivative of the log flux of all SNIa spectra in our sample. 
This is the file given as input to the Deep Learning algorithm. 

- DL_4features_all_epochs.dat
4-dimensional deep learning representation for all spectra in the initial sample.

- DL_4features_atmax.dat
4-dimensional deep learning representation for SNIa spectra at maximum. 

- DL_4features_predictions.dat
4-dimensional predictions from deep learning used for the reconstruction of observed spectra. 

- fluxes_all_epochs.dat
observed fluxes for all spectra in the initial sample, after smoothing. 

- fluxes_atmax.dat
observed fluxes for SNIa spectra at maximum, after smoothing. 

- fluxes_not_res.dat.gz
original fluxes used for reconstruction, before smoothing. 

- indx_counts.dat
- indx_unique.dat
- w.dat
indexes used for quick SOM plot

- mask.dat
identification for all objects in the initial data sample. 
if 1: spectra at maximum 

- reduced_data_pca_7PC.dat
projectios from 7-dimensional PC parameter space for all objects in the initial sample

- residuals.dat
residuals between reconstructed and measured spectra for all objects in the initial sample. 

- residuals_all_matrix.dat
